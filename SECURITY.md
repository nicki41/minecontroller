# Security policy

minecontroller grants whoever runs it Docker-socket access on the host (needed to manage Minecraft server containers) — see [docs/security.md](docs/security.md) for the full threat model and hardening measures.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please **do not** open a public GitHub issue for a security vulnerability. Instead, email **mail@0nicki.de** with:

- A description of the issue and its impact
- Steps to reproduce (or a PoC, if applicable)
- The version/commit you tested against

You should get a response within a few days. Once a fix is available, a new release will be published and the reporter credited (unless anonymity is requested).

## Supported versions

Only the latest `main`/release is supported — there are no maintained older branches.
