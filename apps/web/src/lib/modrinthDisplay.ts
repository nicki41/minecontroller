 * accurately-indexed filter distinct from project_type:mod (verified live
 * against api.modrinth.com — GET /tag/project_type returns
 * ["mod","modpack","resourcepack","shader","plugin","datapack",
 * "minecraft_java_server"]). An earlier version of this file predated that
 * and approximated "Plugin" by OR-ing plugin-family loader categories on
 * top of project_type:mod instead — that under-counted badly (a query for
 * "Plugin" returned ~98 results instead of the real ~16,700) because most
 * plugins on Modrinth aren't also tagged with a matching loader category.
 * Use the real facet directly; it's both simpler and correct.
