# 1000:1000 — reused as-is instead of creating a new one (groupadd -g 1000
# fails outright because that gid is already taken). Conveniently, 1000 is
# also the first regular-user uid on most Linux hosts, so the host ./data
# bind mount can still be given matching ownership predictably — see README
# "Permissions" if you hit EACCES errors on first run.
# gosu: lets entrypoint.sh start as root (needed to grant "node" access to
# the host's Docker-socket group, whose gid isn't known until runtime — see
# entrypoint.sh) and then drop to "node" for everything it actually runs,
# so the app process itself never runs as root.
